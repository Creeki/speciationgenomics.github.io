### Joana Meier

Joana Meier is a Bateson Fellow at St John's College, University of Cambridge, UK. Her research focus is on speciation and evolutionary genomics. Why do some taxa rapidly generate new species, whereas others remain species-poor? She is particularly interested in the role of hybridisation (interbreeding) in rapid speciation and adaptation. Her study systems include *Heliconius* butterflies from the Andes in Ecuador and cichlid fishes from the East African Lake Victoria. You can learn more on [her website](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/joana-meier) or on [her Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5C_BoWQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

### Mark Ravinet

Mark Ravinet is a Marie Curie Fellow at the Centre of Ecology and Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES) at the University of Oslo, Norway. His research focuses on population and speciation genomics, in particular using genomic data to identify regions of the genome involved in divergence and adaptation. He has worked on speciation in sticklebacks, *Littorinia saxatilis* marine snails and more recently on hybrid speciation and adaptation in *Passer* sparrows. You can see more on [his website here](https://genomicislands.wordpress.com/) or on [his Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=GfpvKBwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
