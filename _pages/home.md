Welcome to the December Physalia 2018 course run by Mark Ravinet & Joana Meier.

Follow the links on the lefthand side to take part in the course modules!

The course is now over and we enjoyed it a lot! Thanks to all participants!

If you check the [Speciation genomics github page](https://github.com/speciationgenomics) you will see there are now three new repositories - scripts, data and presentations. Feel free to download any of these as you wish. You can either clone the repositories (see [here](https://speciationgenomics.github.io/going_further_unix/) how to do that) or just download them as a zip file. The scripts directory contains a number of scripts we used throughout the course (bash and R), plus several others that might be of use.
