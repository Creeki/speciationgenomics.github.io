Welcome to the [Physalia](https://www.physalia-courses.org/) September 2019 course run by Mark Ravinet & Joana Meier.

Follow the links on the lefthand side to take part in the course modules.

The [presentations](https://github.com/speciationgenomics/presentations) we gave during the course and the [scripts](https://github.com/speciationgenomics/scripts) and [datasets](https://github.com/speciationgenomics/data) can be downloaded from our [Speciation genomics github page](https://github.com/speciationgenomics). You can either clone the repositories (see [here](https://speciationgenomics.github.io/going_further_unix/) how to do that) or just download them as a zip file. Individual text files can be downloaded by clicking on `raw`. The scripts directory contains a number of scripts we used throughout the course (`bash` and `R`), plus several others that might be of use.
