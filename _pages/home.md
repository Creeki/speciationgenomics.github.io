Welcome to the [Physalia](https://www.physalia-courses.org/) December 2021 course run by Mark Ravinet & Joana Meier.

Follow the links on the lefthand side to take part in the course modules.

The [presentations](https://github.com/speciationgenomics/presentations) we gave during the course and the [scripts](https://github.com/speciationgenomics/scripts) and [datasets](https://github.com/speciationgenomics/data) can be downloaded from our [Speciation genomics github page](https://github.com/speciationgenomics). You can either clone the repositories (see [here](https://speciationgenomics.github.io/going_further_unix/) how to do that) or just download them as a zip file. Individual text files can be downloaded by clicking on `raw`. The scripts directory contains a number of scripts we used throughout the course (`bash` and `R`), plus several others that might be of use.

You can find a recommended reading list [here](https://speciationgenomics.github.io/reading_list/).

<span style="color:red"><b>Disclaimer:
The tutorials and resources on this site are written for the Physalia Speciation genomics course that we have been teaching since 2018. We are really glad to hear that the resources are of use to others that do not participate in the class and we are happy for you to use them.</b></span>

<span style="color:red"><b>However we want to make it clear that we do not actively maintain the resources on the website. Futhermore, the scripts that are implemented are not intended for general use beyond the course. So please use these at your own risk - we are both very busy and do not have time to troubleshoot special use cases. Similarly, some of the large datasets are not available on github but they are publicly available via links in the original papers. If you wish to follow the tutorials, here we encourage you to do so but we cannot help with individual requests. Good luck!</b></span>
